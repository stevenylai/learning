Which functionality does the 'Can Use' permission level enable on a Databricks SQL endpoint?

View own queries, view endpoint details, and start endpoint
--------------------------------
You wrote the following SQL statement to migrate data from an Amazon S3 bucket to an Azure Data Lake Storage location:

COPY INTO COPY INTO delta.`abfss://container/deltaTables/data` 
  WITH (CREDENTIAL target_credential) 
FROM 's3://my-bucket/data' 
  WITH (CREDENTIAL source_credential) 
FILEFORMAT = CSV
VALIDATE

The statement executes successfully, but no data is pushed to the target location. What is the most likely explanation for this?

The query is executing in dry run mode.
--------------------------------
You are a Databricks user who wants to create a local table. How would you accomplish this?

Create the table programmatically.
--------------------------------
You are a data analyst who is visualizing data in Databricks. You execute a query that returns dates and transaction amounts and visualizes the results in a line chart. Databricks shows a vertical line for January 15 values. Why is that?

There are two records for January 15 returned in your query.
--------------------------------
What is a use case of the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL)?

Creating a reusable SQL scalar function
--------------------------------
What is used in Databricks to guarantee transactional commits for SQL queries?

Databricks I/O (DBIO)
--------------------------------
As a data engineer, you create a SQL endpoint computing resource on Databricks. You author a query, but the endpoint slows considerably because more users are concurrently accessing the query. What is one way to improve this performance issue?

Increase the endpoint's cluster scaling maximum.
--------------------------------
Which platform can you use as a destination for a Databricks monitoring alert?

Slack
--------------------------------
How can you run SQL Server on an Ubuntu operating system (OS)?

Have Docker run a SQL Server installation.
--------------------------------
You want to deploy Databricks on an Azure environment. How can you configure the virtual network on Azure for the Databricks deployment?

Create a virtual network with a private container subnet and a public host subnet. Ensure the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block for the subnets is smaller than /26.
--------------------------------
Which plan will allow you to set up a Databricks platform with Serverless SQL Compute endpoints?
